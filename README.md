Thesis code

The code is stored in the ipynb file type.

The Final (except LSTM) file contains code from data collection, data preprocessing, missing value processing, feature engineering, and LR, SVM, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CNN models, as well as sections used to validate and evaluate the models.

The LSTM file includes code ranging from data collection, data preprocessing, missing value processing, feature engineering, and LSTM model related code, as well as a section for validating and evaluating the model.
